    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility â€”
      as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology.
      You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team.
      Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
    </p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
    </ol>
